# chocolate-doom

Chocolate Doom Loader and Translation Layer for TempleOS

![chocolate-doom](https://git.checksum.fail/alec/chocolate-doom/raw/branch/master/preview.gif "chocolate-doom")

# Usage

Clone the repo, create a RedSea `ISO.C` image, `#include "Run";`

The WAD file for the Shareware version of DOOM is included, other game WADs supported by chocolate-doom may or may not work, I have not tested them yet.

I have not implemented save games yet; if you try to save your game, it will crash. 

# TODO

- Sound support

- Save games
